To Do
=====

Fill in the Strategy in lib/passport-pubkey-challenge/strategy.js

This will have to return an appropriately formatted object; `app.js` will call
the Strategy to instantiate it; passing in a `verify` callback.

This callback will define how the users' application handles authentication. In
practice this means that the user provides a callback that is called when we
have an authentication result. (I.E. when someone successfully sends a request
to a URL that was encrypted in a challenge; we know that they have demonstrated
ownership of that fingerprint.)

The part I'm not clear on, is that there are two pertinent routes in `app.js`.

First is /auth/pubkey; which generates a challenge for a given fingerprint
and sends the challenge as an http response.

Second is /auth/pubkey/callback; which is where requests are sent claiming
knowledge of a challenge string. 

There is some way to define both of these in the passport Strategy.
